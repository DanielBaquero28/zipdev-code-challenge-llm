# LLM-Powered Candidate Screener

This app allows recruiters to submit a job description and receive the top 30 ranked candidates, using OpenAI's GPT models.

## Tech Stack

- Next.js + TypeScript
- Python (for LLM logic)
- OpenAI GPT-4
- Jest for testing

## Getting Started
- git clone https://github.com/DanielBaquero28/zipdev-code-challenge-llm.git
- cd zipdev-code-challenge-llm
- npm install (inside the app/)
- pip install -r requirements (inside the llm/)
- Add execution permissions to the score_candidates.py file (chmod +x scored_candidates.py). File located in /llm/src/.

Note: You have by default a loaded preprocessed candidates JSON file with the candidates loaded from the raw xlsx file. Feel free to run the preprocessor_candidates.py file if you want to make some adjustments and optimize this process.

## Environment Variables
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key

## Setup and Installation

- **Set Environment Variables:**
  
  Before running the project, ensure you have set the required environment variables. For example, you can open your terminal and run:
  
  ```bash
  export LLM_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

- Alternatively, create a .env file in the project's root llm (zipdev-code-challenge-llm/llm/) directory with contents similar to:
  LLM_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

- Commands:
  To start the development server, run inside the app/:
  npm run dev

  To run the tests, execute inside the app/:
  npm test

### Project Overview

This project implements a candidate scoring application with the following components:

- Python Backend: Loads candidate data, builds prompts for OpenAI's API, processes responses, and ranks candidates.
- Next.js Frontend: Provides a single-page interface where recruiters enter a job description (â‰¤200 characters) and view the top 30 ranked candidates.
- Testing & Validation: Uses Jest to simulate various scenarios (e.g., input validation, Python process failures, invalid JSON output) ensuring robust error handling and user feedback.
