        "Question 3": "Describe your experience with incident response and performance monitoring in a DevOps environment. How have you contributed to ensuring high availability and reliability of systems?",
        "Answer 3": "I was part of a DevOps team responsible for managing a high-traffic e-commerce platform hosted on AWS. The platform supported thousands of users simultaneously and was critical to the company’s revenue generation. Ensuring high availability, performance, and security was paramount, especially during peak shopping seasons. One evening, during a flash sale event, we began receiving alerts from our monitoring system (Prometheus and CloudWatch) about unusually high latency and sporadic 500 errors on the platform. This was a major issue as it directly impacted user experience and sales. We manually scaled the affected service to handle the increased load and adjusted the auto-scaling configuration to prevent future occurrences. Additionally, a temporary rate limit was applied to manage incoming requests and protect the backend. Throughout the incident, I maintained communication with stakeholders, providing updates on progress and expected resolution times. Once the issue was mitigated, I documented the incident for a post-mortem review. After the incident, I took a proactive approach to avoid similar issues in the future.  I implemented more granular monitoring using Grafana dashboards linked to Prometheus, tracking metrics like CPU utilization, memory usage, response times, and request rates for all critical services. We set up alert thresholds that were more sensitive to early signs of stress. I worked with the team to update our disaster recovery plan, including regular backups of critical data and automated failover procedures. We conducted DR drills to ensure that the team could restore services quickly in the event of a failure. Given the sensitive nature of user data, I also reviewed and tightened security policies, particularly around AWS IAM roles and permissions. This reduced the attack surface and ensured compliance with industry standards. As a result of these efforts, the platform became more resilient and performed better under load. Subsequent flash sales were handled without incident, and the improvements in performance and reliability contributed to a significant increase in user satisfaction and revenue. My proactive monitoring and incident response strategies ensured that the platform remained highly available and secure, even during peak demand.",

On the one hand, my position in start-up was an environment where innovation was a priority and every day was not like the others. In this way, I had to be adaptable and take a lot of responsibilities as well as the titles. In my opinion, this environment was a catalyst for improvement through learning, improvising, and of course thinking out of the box. I was not just solving the problems but also learning the new technologies. The onus is on to automate the technologies that made the company prosper. There were no bottlenecks when I closely worked with other team members, successfully managing, and delivering projects on time. I was able to become more effective through the first-hand experience I got, and the stronger connections I had with my colleagues.",

        "Answer 3": "I’ve worked on resolving build errors for both iOS and Android platforms. One memorable instance was when I was developing an open-world game in Unity. I ran into a frustrating issue where the game kept crashing on startup, but only on iOS devices. After digging into the problem, I found that it was related to how iOS handles memory management and certain API calls. It took some careful optimization and tweaking of the code to make it compatible with iOS, but in the end, the build went through smoothly.\n\nOn the Android side, I faced a different challenge while working on a hyper-casual game. The build process kept failing due to conflicting dependencies in the Gradle files. It turned out to be a tricky version conflict between the two plugins we were using. After some trial and error, I managed to manually adjust the dependencies and modify the Gradle configuration, which finally got the build to succeed.\n\nThese experiences taught me a lot about the nuances of both platforms and the importance of persistence when troubleshooting build errors.",
